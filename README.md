Bespoke Conditional Formatting for Excel expands the number of colors that can be used for conditional formatting and provides a way to save and reapply desired color schemes.

First, the "Studio" version is a way to tinker with and test various parameters in the RGB color display to achieve the desired colors in conditional formatting.  To assist with this, a graph is displayed in the tab labelled "Graph", if desired, but using the graph is not necessary.

The "MultiChoice" is an add-in that demonstrates what can be done with selected parameters once they are chosen, so that the bespoke conditional formatting can be used in your everyday spreadsheets.
